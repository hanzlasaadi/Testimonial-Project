## Overview

- It is a simple testimonials container which I've built with pure CSS & HTML. CSS Grid is what I've utilized to create this beautiful layout. I've also added responsiveness using media queries.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See all the beautiful coloring and little details I've applied here.
- They can also see the same and more beautiful layout on their mobile screens.

## My process

- First I created the main layout containing all the testimonial sections
- Then my most time was taken up by floating the images such that the names appear side by side even with responsisveness, they go down.
- Then, I added the other headings etc and styled it with different colors and fonts.
- With Grid, I used grid-template-areas to style each and every section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I honed my skills with git and github. I learned about CSS Grid and sharped my skills very much. I also leared about responsiveness and dirtied my hands with media queries.

### Continued development

- I really want to learn more about jquery on how it uses radio buttons cause' that is one of weak points.
